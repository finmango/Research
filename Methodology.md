# Summary
Our work operates within this "complex," or systems, context. We embrace an approach centered on probing, sensing, and responding with recognition that systems are dynamic and outcomes unpredictable. Rather than imposing solutions, we allow them to emerge organically from existing circumstances, often implemented through influence rather than control. Our focus lies specifically on the complex ecosystem of young adults worldwide and their financial health—particularly their resilience during transitional periods and financial disruptions.


## 1. Identify
* Our first step is identifying the problem we want to solve. While this may occur in many ways, a successful model is when the involved stakeholders come together with researchers to identify key priorities and assess them through data analysis and economic insights to identify a collective question that can be feasibly approached.

## 2. Diagnose
* We work closely with partners, again using insights from economic theory and empirical evidence, to diagnose the market or system failures that underlie the identified problem. Big data and existing research can often help distinguish among potential explanations and screen for underlying causal factors.

## 3. Design
* We apply our collective expertise to design innovations that adhere to economic principles and are well-supported by evidence. Monitoring and feedback mechanisms are built into every design, often including new tech-based platforms so we can collect and learn from the implementation data.

## 4. Implement
* We test solutions to ensure they are financially, administratively, and politically feasible and then deliver the most effective solution to target beneficiaries via our project partners. Smart data systems capture key indicators of implementation progress to enable continuous problem-solving and learning.

## 5. Measure
* Our approach emphasizes rigorous testing at relevant scale, with scientific methods of evaluation used to measure impact – often comparing several designs via large-scale field studies that draw on tools such as randomized controlled trials. Testing the outcomes of the highest potential solution(s) provides key information on how best to improve and refine.

## 6. Refine
* Our method is an iterative approach, where the lessons learned at each stage are used to refine existing designs and identify the next set of objectives and challenges. During this stage, we may decide that it would be most advantageous to return to a previous point in the process to solve problems or integrate new knowledge. The aim is to use evidence to generate a cycle of continuous policy and programmatic improvement.
