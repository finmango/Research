Preliminary research serves as our intellectual compass, allowing us to explore promising directions before committing substantial resources to full academic studies. Working primarily with University of Virginia students, these initial investigations help us identify viable research questions, test methodologies, and assess potential impact. Similar to white papers in industry, our preliminary research documents emerging insights and foundational discoveries that may later evolve into comprehensive published works. This exploratory approach enables us to remain nimble, pursue innovative paths, and cultivate student researchers while efficiently allocating our scholarly resources toward the most promising avenues of inquiry.
