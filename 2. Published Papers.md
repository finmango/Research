* This article addresses the issue of accessibility related to collecting and publishing Open Data for COVID-19, and suggestions for using the finalized project data in addressing lifestyle behaviors that will inform Health Educators in differing agencies when developing programs for prevention and management of COVID-19. The Mango Model, based on evidence from a COVID-19 Open Data Project was funded by Google Health in partnership with the nonprofit FinMango. First, the purpose and background for the creation of the Open Data Project are provided. Second, outreach to various agencies is addressed. Third, differing methodologies used by agencies for collecting, organizing, automating, and publishing subnational were observed. Fourth, implications for organizations regarding practice, policy and research are discussed. The Google Health and FinMango COVID-19 Open Data Project reinforces the need for a universal standard for publishing open data with consistent reporting. Through the creation of the project, the Mango-Model offers best practices and solutions for universally releasing types of data to assist public health professionals, researchers, policymakers, and others in health-related fields in understanding and managing the virus, and in the mobilization of resources in future responses to local and global need.

* This paper introduces the COVID-19 Open Dataset (COD), available at goo.gle/covid-19-open-data. A static copy is of the dataset is also available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5399355. This is a very large “meta-dataset” of COVID-related data, containing epidemiological information, from 22,579 unique locations within 232 different countries and independent territories. For 62 of these countries we have state-level data, and for 23 of these countries we have county-level data. For 15 countries, COD includes cases and deaths stratified by age or sex. COD also contains information on hospitalizations, vaccinations, and other relevant factors such as mobility, non-pharmaceutical interventions and static demographic attributes. Each location is tagged with a unique identifier so that these different types of information can be easily combined. The data is automatically extracted from 121 different authoritative sources, using scalable open source software. This paper describes the format and construction of the dataset, and includes a preliminary statistical analysis of its content, revealing some interesting patterns.
