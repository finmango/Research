## Google Health Trends (ðŸŸ¢ Active)
Most studies using Google Trends rely on normalized Relative Search Volume (RSV) indices. These indices range from 0 to 100 and reflect a search termâ€™s popularity relative to its peak within a defined time and region. Our study employs the Google Health Trends API to access actual conditional probability values. 

This approach yields:
* Greater mathematical rigor, avoiding distortions introduced by normalization.
* More robust statistical analysis due to interpret-able, probabilistic-ally grounded metrics.
* Cross-term and cross-time comparability, which is not possible with 0â€“100 RSV scales.

As such, our method provides deeper insights into search behavior and allows for more precise linkages.
