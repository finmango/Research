## Why we exist
We collaborate with academic researchers and decision-makers ‚Äî in public, government, and private sectors ‚Äî to help make systems more effective, inclusive, and just. Our approach draws from both experience and evidence; it evolves as we learn from our partners and practice. We strive to address the root causes of financial health and transform systems to achieve equitable outcomes for millions.

## Why our data is unique
Most studies using Google Trends rely on normalized Relative Search Volume (RSV) indices. These indices range from 0 to 100 and reflect a search term‚Äôs popularity relative to its peak within a defined time and region. Our study employs the Google Health Trends API to access actual conditional probability values. 

This approach yields:
* Greater mathematical rigor, avoiding distortions introduced by normalization.
* More robust statistical analysis due to interpret-able, probabilistic-ally grounded metrics.
* Cross-term and cross-time comparability, which is not possible with 0‚Äì100 RSV scales.

As such, our method provides deeper insights into search behavior and allows for more precise linkages with outcomes.


## Why our website is on GitHub
We often think about how to build as much trust as possible with them with our academic partners and funders. We believe transparency ‚Äî in how we think, what we believe and why ‚Äî is the first step to that trust.

So, a few months after we started this trends research, when we were writing an operating manual for ourselves (covering everything from university partners, to diligence questions, core beliefs, etc.), we decided to take a chance and open source it. Partners told us, again and again, how much time it saved to have facts out in the open, how it helped them decide whether to work with us. (The ones who want to skip talking to us also save a step, which is terrific. Time is precious.)

We've moved our entire research presence to GitHub to become even more transparent. Here, you can see how things have changed over time, propose improvements, or even take our ideas and make them your own (we are the gate keepers for the unique data tho üòè). We're grateful you're taking the time to learn about us.

**So here you are. When in doubt, as they say, read the (ahem) manual. :)**
