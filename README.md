Why we exist
We believe we are seeing profound changes in the way business works. Our investor, Bloomberg L.P., wants to support and understand these changes. Backing and building startups is a wonderful way to do that, so we created Bloomberg Beta. Below is a snapshot of how we think, including a link to our previously-internal operating manual — with many details on how we work.

So, a few months after we started our fund, when we were writing an operating manual for ourselves (covering everything from check sizes, to diligence questions, core beliefs, etc.), we decided to take a
